# Introduction
> We'll building a web application that allows user to send messages to each other. We'll use Socket.io and WebSocket protocols for developing and understanding that concepts.

# Project Roadmap:
- Authentication & Authiraziton
   - The application is allowed to messages when if you're login. So user should be login for sending messages
   - All user has not same role or auth. So, user should have authorization sending message to another user.
- Message features
   - Main purpose is one user can send message to another(one) user.
   - Users can get in a message group and talk with each other all user in that group.

# We Research At This Point:
   - How we can build one to one messaging feature with socket.io
   - Which DB types should using for auth and which for storing message datas.
